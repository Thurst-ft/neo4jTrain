### Interesting cypers

```
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS
 FROM $url + "/groups.csv"
 AS row
 RETURN row
 LIMIT 10
 ```

The $url is the paramter we created in the first step where we set the params/

### Example basic queries

match groups and return count:
```
MATCH (g:Group) RETURN count(*)
```

return tabel of id, name and url name
```
MATCH (g:Group)
 RETURN g.id, g.name, g.urlname
 ```

 Add in constrains

 ```
 CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (t:Topic) ASSERT t.id IS UNIQUE
 ```

 Get constraints
 ```
 CALL db.constraints()
 ```
 Get indexes

 ```
 CALL db.indexes()
 ```

 ```
MERGE (:topic {uuid:""})
ON CREATE SET //

```
Exclude really common stuff
ie
```
WHERE size((topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-()) < 100
```
Test where a predicat exist or `NOT`
```
WHERE EXISTS((Group)-[:HAS_REL]->(Topic)))

WHERE NOT EXISTS((Group)-[:HAS_REL]->(Topic)))
```
 ## Useful commands

Outputs the schema so you can see the constrains applied etc.
 ```
 :schema
```


Indexes have constraints but constraints don't necessrsary have an index.

Indexes are design to be used to find the starting point.

## Using periodic commits
Can only be used with `LOAD CSV`
flushes after n amount of rows to avoid outOfMemory issues

### Limits
35kb node
15kb rel
65k rel per node
2 to the power of 50 is the limit on nodes
2 ^ 50

### Notes on WITH
sub queryish

Used to capture the query and do some aggregation

- limit number of entries ton to the othe rmatch clause

- filter on agrigate
- separate reading ..
